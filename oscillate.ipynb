    "Given a set of target tuning curves, our first goal is to train synaptic parameters such that, when population of complex neuron models is simulated within a network, the observed spike rates resemble the rates given by the target tuning curves. The parameters trained by our model include the synaptic weight, decomposed into encoders and decoders, and the time constants of a synaptic filter, specifically a double-exponential filter with $\\tau_{\\text{rise}}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{fall}}$. To adjust encoders and decoders, we use an online learning rule that includes a Hebbian component, a supervised component in the spike-space, and an error-driven component in the state-space. To adjust synaptic time constants, we use an offline optimization procedure that utilizes a least squares solver and the Hyperopt optimization package. The network used to implement the learning rule and optimization is shown below, with the quantities in red updated by the learning rule and the quantities in blue updated by the optimization."
